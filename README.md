# execute-until [![](https://circleci.com/gh/lazycuh/execute-until.svg?style=svg&logo=appveyor)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/lazycuh/execute-until?branch=main)

A function that returns a promise that will only resolve when the predicate function resolves to `true` for async predicate or returns `true` for sync version. This is useful for cases when you need to perform some long running operation before proceeding.

The predicate function will be repeatedly called until it resolves to `true` which causes the asynchronous execution to proceed. By default, the predicate function is called every 500ms.

Please note that this function will reject when the predicate function throws an error/rejects at most 3 times.
